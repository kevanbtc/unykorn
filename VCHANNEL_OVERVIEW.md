# V-CHANNEL on Polygon Layer 1

This document outlines the proposed V-CHANNEL system built on Polygon L1 using Unykorn infrastructure as a base. The architecture combines entertainment, education, and commerce features with on-chain identity and compliance.

## Key Contracts

- **GlacierMint.sol** – ERC‑721/SBT registrar for `.tv` top-level domains. Responsible for minting TLDs and assigning vaults.
- **TVVault.sol** – ERC‑6551 compliant vault contract controlling user media channels. Subdomains (e.g. `creator.tv`) map to individual vaults.
- **PPVPaymentModule.sol** – Handles pay‑per‑view ticketing and unlock logic for encrypted streams.
- **RoyaltyRouter.sol** – Routes streaming revenue to creators, investors, DAO affiliates, and tax vaults.
- **EducationDAO.sol** – Governs community education initiatives and access to curriculum vaults.

## High‑Level Flow

1. **ERC‑4337** smart wallet login.
2. Upon login, the user receives a `.tv` identity vault via **GlacierMint**.
3. Content creators upload videos or streams to IPFS and attach them to their vault.
4. **PPVPaymentModule** verifies ticket purchases and unlocks content.
5. **RoyaltyRouter** splits revenue between stakeholders and the DAO.
6. **EducationDAO** manages K‑12 courses and allows token‑gated access through vaults.

## Deployment Targets

- Polygon Mainnet
- IPFS (Pinata) for media storage
- Hardhat deployment scripts for contract deployment and registration

This repository includes contract skeletons and documentation only. Further development is required to fully implement the system.
