# Tokenomics

## Enhanced Token Economics

### Token Supply & Distribution
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion tokens)
- **Psychology:** Large numbers create sense of abundance ("millions of tokens")
- **Initial Allocation:**
  - Community airdrop: 50%
  - LP bootstrap: 30%
  - Marketing treasury: 10%
  - Team locked: 10%

### Burn Mechanism
- **Burn Rate:** Configurable 2-5% on every transfer (default 3%)
- **Purpose:** Deflationary pressure to increase scarcity over time
- **Governance:** DAO-controlled burn rate adjustments
- **Exemptions:** Minting and burning operations exempt

### Early Pack System
Tiered early access packages with token allocations and benefits:

#### Pack Tiers (Example)
- **$25 Pack:** 1M tokens + 60-day lockup + basic perks
- **$50 Pack:** 2.5M tokens + 60-day lockup + enhanced perks  
- **$100 Pack:** 6M tokens + 90-day lockup + premium perks

#### Lockup Mechanics
- **Purpose:** Prevent early dumping and reward long-term holders
- **Duration:** 60-90 days based on pack tier
- **Enforcement:** Smart contract prevents transfers during lockup
- **Governance:** Lockup periods adjustable via DAO

### Long-term Economic Model

#### Supply Dynamics
- **Deflationary Pressure:** Continuous burn reduces supply
- **Utility Demand:** POC, POI, and commerce drive usage
- **Scarcity Premium:** Decreasing supply with growing adoption
- **Vault Backing:** Real assets provide fundamental value floor

#### Network Effects
- **Merchant Adoption:** More merchants → more utility
- **User Growth:** More users → more POC/POI activity  
- **Geographic Expansion:** More territories → more opportunity
- **Asset Diversification:** More vault assets → more stability

The tokenomics are designed to create sustainable, long-term value through:
1. Deflationary supply mechanics
2. Diversified asset backing
3. Multi-stakeholder revenue sharing
4. Governance-driven evolution
5. Real-world utility and adoption
