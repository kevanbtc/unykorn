## Melanie Vaughn – Case Data (Fight File)

### Case Basics

* **Case No.**: 50-2025-DR-004546-XXXA-SB
* **Division**: FX – South Branch Family Division, Palm Beach County, Florida
* **Parties**:
  * Petitioner: **Anthony Puglisi (Father)**
  * Respondent: **Melanie Vaughn (Mother)**
* **Child**: Savannah P. (born January 2021, now 4 y/o)

### Court Orders & Events

* **May 22, 2025** → Petition for Paternity filed by father (custody, timesharing, support, parenting plan).
* **June 12, 2025** → Father files **Emergency Motion** to suspend timesharing.
* **June 20, 2025** → Judge Martz grants motion:
  * **Timesharing suspended** (no contact until further hearing).
  * Cites alleged **drug abuse, overdose, threats with gun, flight risk**.
  * Recommends father seek **Risk Protection Order (RPO)**.
* **Hearing Findings** (June 20 order):
  * Father testified Melanie OD’d in May 2025 → coma, psych treatment.
  * Father alleges past gun threats (2024, 2025).
  * Stepmom (Kathy Rifkin) testified: Melanie threatened to “come to Florida and kill him,” sent gun picture.
  * Court accepted allegations as true (since Melanie **absent** at hearing).
  * Court concluded: “Not in best interest of child for Melanie to have timesharing now.”

### Legal Retainer Barrier

* Bruce Law Firm (Ashley & Chris Bruce) offered representation:
  * **$7,500 trust deposit required**.
  * Hourly rates: $600 (Chris), $450 (Ashley/Jason), $250–450 (associates), $100–250 (paralegals).
* You cannot afford → must self-represent OR use AI/legal tech system to generate filings.

### Weak Points in Father’s Case (Opportunities)

1. **One-sided evidence** → Melanie wasn’t present at June 20 hearing, so court **only heard father + stepmom**. That order is **temporary**.
2. **Sobriety recovery window** → Court explicitly tied future contact/timesharing to **Melanie’s treatment/sobriety progress**.
3. **No child abuse findings** → Court noted “concerns” but did not find Melanie abused Savannah directly.
4. **Expedited basis** → Order says Melanie can request expedited hearing to contest allegations.
5. **Bias risk** → Allegations rely heavily on testimony from father + stepmom, both potentially biased.

### Filing Strategy (Self-Rep / AI Support)

1. **Motion for Communication**
   * Request reinstatement of phone/video calls with Savannah.
   * Cite child’s best interest in maintaining bond.
   * Emphasize willingness to comply with conditions (supervised calls, therapy support).
2. **Motion to Reinstate Timesharing**
   * Attach sobriety proof: rehab attendance, therapy records, drug/alcohol test results.
   * Request graduated schedule (supervised → unsupervised → overnight).
3. **Affidavits & Evidence**
   * Letters from family/friends on sobriety & caregiving.
   * Document stable housing, employment, therapy.
4. **Cross-Exam Prep**
   * Challenge father’s credibility and stepmom bias.
