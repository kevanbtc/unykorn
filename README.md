# Unykorn NFT Marketplace

This repository contains example Solidity contracts for an NFT marketplace with staking functionality. It has been extended with documentation and skeleton contracts for the proposed **V‑CHANNEL** system on Polygon Layer 1.

## Existing Contracts

- `NFTMarketplace.sol` handles listing and purchasing NFTs with a configurable fee.
- `NFTStaking.sol` allows users to stake their NFTs to earn ETH rewards over time.

## V‑CHANNEL Additions

The `VCHANNEL_OVERVIEW.md` document provides an outline of a new entertainment and education stack built on Polygon. Contract stubs for the system are located under `contracts/`:

- `GlacierMint.sol`
- `TVVault.sol`
- `PPVPaymentModule.sol`
- `RoyaltyRouter.sol`
- `EducationDAO.sol`

These stubs serve as starting points for future development.
