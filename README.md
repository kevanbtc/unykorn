# 🪙 RWA-Backed Stablecoin System

## 📌 Overview

This repository implements a **compliance-first, production-ready stablecoin system backed by real-world assets (RWAs)** such as U.S. Treasuries, bonds, commodities, or real estate.

The stack includes:

* **Stablecoin ERC-20** — role-gated mint/burn with compliance enforcement.
* **ComplianceManager** — admin-controlled whitelist for KYC/AML.
* **RWARegistry** — proof-of-reserve tracking with collateral ratios and freeze capability.
* **OracleConnector** — pluggable oracle interface with timestamped updates.
* **GovernanceTimelock** — DAO/multisig time-delayed governance.
* **EmergencyPause** — circuit breaker to halt operations in crisis.

## ⚙️ Contracts

### Stablecoin.sol

* ERC-20 token implementation.
* Mint/burn gated by `MINTER_ROLE` / `BURNER_ROLE`.
* Enforces whitelist via `ComplianceManager`.
* Logs RWA references on mint/burn.

### ComplianceManager.sol

* Role-controlled whitelist system.
* Provides `isWhitelisted()` checks for compliance gating.
* Emits events for regulator/audit trails.

### RWARegistry.sol

* Maps RWAs to collateral ratios, proofs, and timestamps.
* Stores custodian Merkle roots or attestation hashes.
* Supports asset freezing during disputes or fraud.

### OracleConnector.sol

* Updates asset prices with timestamps.
* Provides medianization / staleness checks.
* Designed for Chainlink, Pyth, or custom integrations.

### GovernanceTimelock.sol

* OpenZeppelin Timelock-based governance.
* DAO/multisig authority.
* Enforced delay on parameter updates to prevent malicious pushes.

### EmergencyPause.sol

* Pausable system-wide circuit breaker.
* Admin role required to pause/unpause.
* Ensures systemic safety under attack or custodian failure.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v18+
* Hardhat
* OpenZeppelin contracts

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Deploy contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat run deploy/01_deploy.js --network <network>
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Key coverage:

* ✅ Whitelist enforcement (mint/burn restricted).
* ✅ Proof-of-reserve asset updates with oracle input.
* ✅ Oracle price feed timestamp checks.
* ✅ Governance timelock delay enforcement.
* ✅ Emergency pause halts transfers/mints.

---

## 🔒 Compliance

* **KYC/AML enforcement:** whitelist gating at issuance/redemption.
* **Proof-of-Reserve:** off-chain custodian attestations stored on-chain.
* **On-chain auditability:** event logs for all issuance/redemption tied to RWA IDs.
* **Emergency controls:** pause mechanism for systemic failures.
* **Governance transparency:** timelocked parameter updates.

---

## 💰 Monetization

* **Mint/redeem fees** (bps-level).
* **Yield from collateral** (e.g. treasuries, lending markets).
* **Liquidity incentives** (DEX pools, MM deals, Curve/Uniswap integration).

---

## 📜 Next Steps

* Add redemption priority queue for liquidity crises.
* Extend integration tests with oracle + registry end-to-end mint flow.
* Formal verification & audit (Slither, Echidna, Certora).
* Cross-chain deployments with canonical bridge support.

This repo is **audit-prep and production-ready**, designed for **stablecoin issuers tying tokens to real-world assets under full compliance**.
