# Unykorn NFT Marketplace

This repository contains example Solidity smart contracts for an NFT marketplace with staking functionality. The contracts demonstrate how to list ERCâ€‘731 tokens for sale and allow holders to stake their NFTs to earn rewards.

## Contracts

- `NFTMarketplace.sol` handles listing and purchasing NFTs with a configurable fee.
- `NFTStaking.sol` allows users to stake their NFTs to earn ETH rewards over time.

These contracts rely on [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) libraries. They can be compiled and tested using tools such as Remix or Hardhat.
